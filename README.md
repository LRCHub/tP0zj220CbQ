[00:00.84] If I should stay
[00:08.18] I would only be in your way
[00:15.34] So I'll go, but I know
[00:22.41] That I'll think of you every step of the way
[00:44.41] 
[00:30.87] And I will always love you
[00:40.92] I, I'll always love you
[00:51.92] My darling, you
[00:59.42] 
[00:55.74] Bittersweet memories
[01:03.36] That is all I am taking with me
[01:10.88] So goodbye
[01:13.69] Please don't cry
[01:17.89] 'Cause we both know I am not what you need
[01:38.89] 
[01:25.82] And I will always love you
[01:38.92] Will always love you
[01:48.92] 
[01:58.38] So I hope life treats you kind
[02:06.38] And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
[02:13.40] And I wish you joy and happiness
[02:20.70] But above all this I wish you love
[02:37.70] 
[02:28.86] And I will always love you
[02:41.23] I will always love you
[02:46.66] I will always love you
[02:56.72] I will always love you
