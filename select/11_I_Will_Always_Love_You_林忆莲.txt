《I will always love you》
If I should stay,
I would only be in your way.
So Ill go, but I know
Ill think of you evry step of the way.
And I will always love you.
I will always love you.
You, my darling you. Hmm.
Bittersweet memories
that is all Im taking with me.
So, goodbye. Please, dont cry.
We both know Im not what you, you need.
And I will always love you.
I will always love you.

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all youve dreamed of.
And I wish to you, joy and happiness.
But above all this, I wish you love.
And I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
I, I will always love you.
You, darling, I love you.
Ooh, Ill always, Ill always love you.
